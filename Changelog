⚙️ Expense Tracker v1.4 — UI Cleanup & Dark Mode Upgrade
🚀 Version Summary

A major frontend UI update introducing dark mode, smoother navigation, and overall polish across login, signup, and dashboard pages — improving both aesthetics and usability.

🧠 Core Functional Updates
🔄 Routing & Navigation

Updated main.jsx:

Added theme auto-detection (system preference + localStorage persistence).

Added routes for /login, /signup, /dashboard, /add, /list, /budget.

Removed redundant routes and unnecessary re-renders.

Improved routing flow — redirects happen silently (no “Redirecting…” prompt).

🔐 Login & Authentication

Removed annoying “Redirecting to Dashboard” prompt.

Login now directly navigates to /dashboard after token validation.

Session expiry now silently logs out and redirects to login.

Signup page now includes a “Already have an account? Login” link.
