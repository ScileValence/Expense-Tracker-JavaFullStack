🔐 New Features in v1.3
1. Secure JWT Authentication

Added /api/auth/register and /api/auth/login endpoints.

Users are now stored securely in the MySQL database with BCrypt password hashing.

JWT tokens generated upon login and stored in browser localStorage.

Backend endpoints protected and ready for role-based access (v1.3).

2. Seamless Frontend Integration

Login and Signup forms now communicate directly with backend APIs.

Token automatically included in Axios requests via interceptors.

Auto-redirect to Dashboard post successful authentication.

Logout clears JWT and redirects to login.

3. Consistent Modern UI

Complete visual redesign with clean card-based layout and unified CSS.

Dashboard, Add Expense, Budget, and Expense List pages now share consistent:

Typography, padding, and color theme

Button design with smooth hover states

Responsive container and spacing

Added Back buttons and contextual navigation between routes.

4. Route Management

Fixed routing structure:

/dashboard — Main summary

/add — Add or edit expenses

/list — View all expenses

/budget — Manage monthly budget

Updated main.jsx to import components from /components/ folder.

5. Improved Code Structure

Clean separation of concerns:

/pages/ — Authentication and Dashboard views

/components/ — Functional modules (AddExpense, ExpenseList, BudgetForm)

Added api.js (Axios base config with token injection).
